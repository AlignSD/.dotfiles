# My Dotfiles

This repository hosts my dotfiles for both my development environment as well as my arch linux/hyprland environment.

# Installation References

We're using GNU Stow to manage our dotfiles. This application creates syslinks to our dotfiles allowing us to store all of our dotfiles in a .dotfiles directory
